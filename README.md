- Project Description/Outline:
  Analyze 3 years of electricity usage and weather patterns for California to see how it has changed.

* Research Questions to Answer:
  How has electricity demand changed over the last 3 years in California?
  How has temperature changed over the last 3 years in California?
  What does solar production look like in 2015 to now?
  Is renewable generation more in the summer versus the winter?
